# How far does the data go back to?

Summer 2014

# How often will grades be added and updated?

New grades are added once the data becomes available, usually a few weeks after the quarter is over.

# Why are the +/- grades not shown?

Unfortunately, we weren't able to obtain the +/- data from UCI.

# What does Exclude Only P/NP Classes do?

It excludes classes that grade in only Pass/No Pass from the search result.

# What does Exclude COVID-19 do?

It excludes Winter 2020, Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Winter 2021, Spring 2021, Summer 2021 from the search result.

# How did you get the data?

The data is retrieved from the [PeterPortal API](https://github.com/icssc-projects/peterportal-public-api). Please report any data related issues directly to the [PeterPortal API repo](https://github.com/icssc-projects/peterportal-public-api/issues).

# Why can't I find a certain class?

UCI might be withholding that class's data, or the instructor may have submitted grades late so the data wasn't collected in time. UCI doesn't release grade distribution data for classes with 10 students or less.

# Why can't I find a certain instructor?

There are 3 possible reasons:

- If they are a professor/lecturer, it may be for the same reasons as "Why can't I find a certain class?" above.
- If they are a TA, they may not be listed in the database, or the professor is listed instead of the TA.
- If the class has multiple instructors, only one teacher may have been mentioned in the database.

# Why is it called Zotistics?

Zot + Statistics

# Why are there dogs on the homepage?
